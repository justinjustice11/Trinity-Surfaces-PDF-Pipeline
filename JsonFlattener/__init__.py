print("Detected sheets:", list(sheets.keys()))

# (Then, for example:)
quotes_df       = sheets['Quotes']            # or whatever the exact key turns out to be
samples_df      = sheets['Samples by rep']   # <-- note trailing space?

# From there you can parse each oneâ€™s date & value columns,
# aggregate monthly, plot quotes vs. sales vs. opportunities vs. samples,
# and compute correlations to see which pipeline metric best (and worst)
# predicts actual sales.
